# aline-deployment

A host repo for all deployment files I wrote during a recent project.

The application files are not in this repo as I do not own them but included are the following

- Dockerfiles for all micro-components
- k8s deployment/service files for each component
- Jenkinsfiles for each component's pipeline
- Terraform resources to host the app on AWS
- Ansible roles to automate the setup of Jenkins and SonarQube for each component
